# UPLOADIT

### Introduction

UPLOADIT is a novel UX design of a mobile app that produces a user accessible experience of image sharing, image viewing, video viewing, and Liking (an important part of sharing and viewing content). Current social media applications that prioritize image sharing forgo to prioritize subsequent aspects, such as, the ease of viewing and Liking images or videos. UPLOADIT prioritizes all aspects of image sharing and allows for a more advanced and organized experience. This is done so through the key features of the app, which include dated tabs to categorize images on profiles, a developed “Likes” page in the navigation, and video control buttons. The application, though advanced in its features, remains simple to use for all users alike. More specifically, it is for users who enjoy social media, art, photography, image sharing, but want to enjoy a thorough experience that allows for rewatching, reviewing, and revisiting.

### Design Statement

My goal of the project was to resolve the lack of user control and freedom as well as to improve accessibility to key features of social media applications. Solving the problems aforementioned is important because I hope to produce an experience of image sharing that is worthwhile, easy to navigate, less frustrating, and not time consuming. Furthermore, I would like for my mobile application to leave users satisfied with its efficiency, knowing images and videos are carefully organized with their experiened in mind.
